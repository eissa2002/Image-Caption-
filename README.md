# Image Captioning Project

This project implements an image captioning model using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to generate descriptive captions for images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

## Features

- Uses pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet201) for feature extraction from images.
- Employs RNNs (LSTM layers) for generating captions based on extracted features.
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- Implements early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques for efficient training.
- Utilizes tokenization and padding for handling text data.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eissa2002/image-captioning.git
    cd image-captioning
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data

The project uses the Flickr 8k dataset for training and evaluation. You can download the dataset from the following links:

- [Flickr Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)
- [Flickr 8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)

After downloading, place the data in the appropriate directories as follows:

Great! Let's include the details about the data sources in the README file. Here's an updated version incorporating the data links:

image-captioning/
│
├── data/
│ ├── images/ # Directory for storing images
│ └── captions/ # Directory for storing captions


## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your image data and corresponding captions in the appropriate directories.
2. **Training**: Run the notebook `imagecaption.ipynb` to train the model. The notebook includes all necessary steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to generate captions for new images. The prediction code is included in the notebook.
